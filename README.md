Rotating Navigation

This code is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based webpage that implements a rotating navigation. The webpage contains a main content area with some article text and an image, and a side navigation.

The HTML code sets up the structure of the webpage with a head section that includes a title and meta tags, and a body section that contains the main content and the navigation. The body also includes links to a CSS file and a JavaScript file that provide the styling and functionality of the page, respectively.

The CSS code sets up some basic styles for the page, such as the font family, background color, and color of the text. It also specifies styles for the main content container, the side navigation, and the buttons for opening and closing the navigation.

The JavaScript code provides the functionality for rotating the main content container to reveal the side navigation. When the "open" button is clicked, the JavaScript code adds a class to the container that applies a transform to rotate the container, revealing the navigation. When the "close" button is clicked, the JavaScript code removes the class, rotating the container back to its original position.

Overall, this code provides a simple implementation of a rotating navigation, which can be a useful UI design element in certain contexts.
